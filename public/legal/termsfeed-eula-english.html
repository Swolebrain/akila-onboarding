    <h2>Purchases</h2>

    <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service (&quot;Purchase&quot;), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.</p>

    <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>


    <h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>

    <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites.

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Akila Labs Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Akila Labs Inc. customer support team.</p>

    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Akila Labs Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Akila Labs Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Akila Labs Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>


    <h2>Free Trial</h2>

    <p>Akila Labs Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (&quot;Free Trial&quot;).</p>

    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>

    <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Akila Labs Inc. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>

    <p>At any time and without notice, Akila Labs Inc. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>


    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>

    <p>Akila Labs Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

    <p>Akila Labs Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
